## Codebase Patterns
- Path alias `@/*` maps to project root (tsconfig paths)
- Project uses Next.js 16, React 19, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS v4, lucide-react icons
- Existing onboarding context is in `lib/onboarding-context.tsx` with 3 steps (business-information, address, compliance-transaction)
- Pre-existing typecheck errors exist in `stablecoin/page.tsx`, `dashboard-content.tsx`, `gated-action-button.tsx`, and `onboarding-card.tsx` — these are unrelated to widget work
- Use `"use client"` directive for client components
- Guard `localStorage` access with `typeof window === "undefined"` for SSR safety
- Mock API uses localStorage key `onboarding-progress`; widget-dismissed uses `widget-dismissed`
- OnboardingWizard has its own internal steps — doesn't consume context steps, so context changes are backward compatible
- OnboardingStep now has a `type` field (`action` | `passive` | `terminal`) from the step config
- Use a `hydrated` state flag + `useEffect` to read localStorage initial values safely (prevents SSR hydration mismatch)
- Widget dismiss state uses `isWidgetDismissed`/`setWidgetDismissed` from OnboardingContext (backed by localStorage `widget-dismissed`)
- NavSecondary uses `useOnboarding()` — it must be inside OnboardingProvider
- Use `useIsMobile()` from `hooks/use-mobile.ts` for responsive behavior (breakpoint 768px)
- On mobile, expanded widget uses `inset-x-0 bottom-0 w-full rounded-b-none` for full-width bottom sheet

- Created `lib/onboarding-steps.ts` with the 9-step STEPS array and exported interfaces
- Interfaces: `OnboardingStepConfig` (id, title, description?, type) and `OnboardingProgress` (stepId-to-boolean mapping)
- Steps in order: business-details, business-information, address, compliance-transaction, business-members, documents, pricing-fees, compliance-review (passive), go-live (terminal)
- Files changed: `lib/onboarding-steps.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The existing 3 steps in onboarding-context.tsx are a subset of the new 9 steps — US-003 will need to map them
  - OnboardingProgress uses index signature `[stepId: string]: boolean` for flexibility
  - Type field distinguishes action (user-completable), passive (system-driven), and terminal (auto-completed) steps

- Created `lib/mock-onboarding-api.ts` with `fetchOnboardingProgress()` and `updateStepStatus()` functions
- Uses localStorage key `onboarding-progress` for persistence
- 200-500ms artificial delay via setTimeout/Promise for realistic async behavior
- Internal `readProgress()` helper avoids double-delay when `updateStepStatus` reads current state
- SSR-safe: returns defaults when `window` is undefined
- Files changed: `lib/mock-onboarding-api.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep sync read helpers separate from async public API to avoid compounding delays
  - Always guard `localStorage` access with `typeof window === "undefined"` check for Next.js SSR

  - Rewrote `lib/onboarding-context.tsx` to import from `onboarding-steps.ts` and `mock-onboarding-api.ts`
  - On mount, calls `fetchOnboardingProgress()` to hydrate step completion from localStorage
  - `completeStep` now also persists via `updateStepStatus()`; blocks passive-type steps
  - Added `approveComplianceReview()` which marks compliance-review and auto-completes terminal (go-live) step
  - Added `isWidgetDismissed` / `setWidgetDismissed` backed by localStorage key `widget-dismissed`
  - `OnboardingStep` interface now includes `type` field alongside existing `id`, `title`, `completed`, `hasForm`
  - `buildSteps()` helper maps STEPS configs + progress into the OnboardingStep shape for backward compat
  - Files changed: `lib/onboarding-context.tsx`
  - **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - OnboardingWizard manages its own internal steps independently — it doesn't consume context steps, so the 9-step expansion is fully backward compatible
  - The `type` field on OnboardingStep is new — consumers that only use `id`/`title`/`completed`/`hasForm` remain unaffected
  - Pre-existing typecheck errors (29 total) in stablecoin/page.tsx, dashboard-content.tsx, gated-action-button.tsx, onboarding-card.tsx, chart.tsx, withdrawal-wizard.tsx are unrelated to widget work

- Created `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx` as a `"use client"` component
- Fixed-position Card in bottom-right (right-4 bottom-4 z-50), 360px wide
- Header with "Setup guide" title, "X of 9 steps completed" text, and ChevronDown collapse button
- Linear Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Step list with Check icon (completed), Lock icon (locked), empty circle (current/available)
- Active step highlighted with `bg-accent` and `font-medium`
- Steps are sequential — locked unless all previous steps completed
- Max-height 480px with overflow-y-auto scroll area
- Uses shadcn Card, Button, Progress and lucide-react Check, Lock, ChevronDown icons
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `isStepLocked` helper checks all previous steps — useful for click navigation in US-006
  - Widget currently only renders expanded state — US-005 will add collapsed pill toggle
  - ChevronDown button is wired but has no toggle state yet — US-005 will add that

- Added collapsed pill state to `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx` with toggle boolean
- Collapsed pill: rounded button with SVG circular progress ring (ProgressRing component) and "X/9" text
- Clicking pill expands widget; clicking ChevronDown in header collapses to pill
- Expand/collapse state persists in localStorage key `widget-expanded`
- Transition between states uses Tailwind `transition-all duration-200`
- Added `hydrated` flag to prevent SSR/hydration mismatch on localStorage read
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ProgressRing is a local SVG component in setup-guide-widget.tsx — reusable if needed elsewhere
  - Hydration guard (`hydrated` state + `useEffect`) is needed for any localStorage-driven initial state to avoid SSR mismatch
  - The pill uses `bg-primary` and `text-primary-foreground` to match the app's theme

- Added step click navigation to `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- Unlocked action steps (completed or current) are clickable and navigate via `navigateToOnboarding(step.id)`
- Locked steps show `cursor-not-allowed` and clicks are no-ops
- Passive steps (compliance-review) are never clickable
- Terminal steps (go-live) are not clickable until completed (auto-completed when compliance review approved)
- Clicking a step also collapses the widget to pill state via `setExpanded(false)`
- Added keyboard accessibility (role="button", tabIndex, Enter/Space handlers)
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `step.type` field is the key discriminator for click behavior — passive never clickable, terminal only when completed
  - `navigateToOnboarding` from context handles the URL construction (`/dashboard/onboarding?step={stepId}`)
  - Collapsing on click is a UX pattern: navigate + minimize widget to avoid blocking the form

- Added Compliance Review waiting state UI to `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- When all steps before compliance-review are complete, shows Clock icon (amber) and "Under review — approx. 2–3 business days" text
- Added "(Demo: Approve)" button that calls `approveComplianceReview()` from context
- `isComplianceInProgress` derived from: passive type + not completed + not locked
- When approved, compliance-review shows checkmark and go-live auto-completes
- Imported `Clock` from lucide-react and `approveComplianceReview` from context
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `isComplianceInProgress` flag (`isPassive && !step.completed && !locked`) is reusable for any passive step waiting state
  - Use `e.stopPropagation()` on nested buttons inside clickable rows to prevent parent click handlers from firing
  - The compliance review row gets the same `bg-accent` highlight as the active step when in-progress

- Added Go Live terminal state and completion celebration to `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- Go Live step already showed locked state (Lock icon, muted) until Compliance Review approved — existing behavior from US-007
- When Compliance Review approved, Go Live auto-completes (via `approveComplianceReview` in context) and now shows "Operations Live" text below the step title
- Header shows "You're all set!" message (in primary color) when all 9 steps are completed, replacing the "X of 9 steps completed" text
- Progress bar naturally shows 100% when all steps complete (already handled by existing `progressValue` calculation)
- Used `isOnboardingComplete` from context to drive the completion message
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `isOnboardingComplete` from context is the canonical flag for all-steps-done state — use it rather than recalculating
  - Terminal step completion text ("Operations Live") is rendered conditionally via `isTerminal && step.completed`
  - The "You're all set!" message replaces the step counter in the header — not an additional element

  - Added '...' dropdown menu (shadcn DropdownMenu) to expanded widget header with "Dismiss setup guide" option
  - Dismissing sets `isWidgetDismissed(true)` via context, hiding widget completely and persisting to localStorage
  - Widget returns `null` when `isWidgetDismissed` is true — does not render on subsequent page loads
  - Added "Show setup guide" toggle in `nav-secondary.tsx` that appears only when widget is dismissed, calls `setWidgetDismissed(false)`
  - Auto-dismiss: when all 9 steps complete, a 3-second timeout fires `setWidgetDismissed(true)` (cleanup on unmount)
  - Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`, `components/nav-secondary.tsx`
  - **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DropdownMenu imports: `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuTrigger` from `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu`
  - Use `useRef` for setTimeout timers + cleanup in `useEffect` return to avoid stale timers
  - NavSecondary now depends on OnboardingContext — ensure it's always rendered within OnboardingProvider

- Imported `SetupGuideWidget` in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` and rendered it inside OnboardingProvider, after SidebarProvider
- Widget is now visible on all dashboard sub-routes (/dashboard, /dashboard/onboarding, etc.)
- Placed after SidebarProvider so widget is outside the sidebar layout flow — renders as fixed-position overlay without interfering
- Files changed: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Widget must be inside OnboardingProvider but can be outside SidebarProvider since it doesn't use sidebar context
  - Fixed-position widget (z-50) renders as overlay — no layout interference with sidebar or page content

- Added responsive mobile behavior to `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- Imported `useIsMobile` from `hooks/use-mobile.ts` (768px breakpoint)
- On mobile (< 768px), widget defaults to collapsed pill state when no localStorage preference exists
- Expanded state on mobile takes full width at bottom of viewport (`inset-x-0 bottom-0 w-full rounded-b-none`)
- Collapsed pill remains positioned `right-4 bottom-4` on all viewports (compact, no overlap)
- No horizontal scroll issues — full-width bottom sheet avoids overflow
- Files changed: `components/setup-guide-widget.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `useIsMobile()` returns `false` on SSR (initial `undefined` coerced via `!!`) — safe for conditional rendering after hydration
  - Mobile expanded uses `inset-x-0` (left-0 right-0) + `w-full` for full-width bottom sheet pattern
  - `rounded-b-none` removes bottom border-radius when widget is flush with viewport bottom
